# Microcontroller Board
## Designed for signa integrity

This board connects a PIC16 or PIC18 microcontroller to a series of LED and resistor combos, this board was designed for university work

The goal of this design was to produce a small board which used different design principles taught throughout first semester to have great signal integrity
