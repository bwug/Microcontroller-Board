<h1>Microcontroller Board</h1>
<h6>Designed for signal integrity</h6>

This board connects a _PIC16_ or _PIC18_ microcontroller to a series of LED and resistor combos, this board was designed for university work though is more than viable for real-world testing applications due to the simplicity of individual pin testing

The goal of this design was to produce a small board which used different design principles taught throughout first semester to have great signal integrity

Use [KiCanvas](https://kicanvas.org/) to view the board, the [PCB](https://kicanvas.org/?github=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbwug%2FMicrocontroller-Board%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fsignal_board.kicad_pcb) can be seen here and the [schematic](https://kicanvas.org/?github=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbwug%2FMicrocontroller-Board%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fsignal_board.kicad_sch) here.

This project helped me develop my skills in developing boards when conciously thinking about the signals used throughout the circuit, as well as designing with a philosophy of "If someone uses this, will they be able to solder onto it?"
